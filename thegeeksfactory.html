					<p id="one"> TheGeeksFactory is a multi-faceted project created by Sane the Geek that explores a wide range of Artistic endeavors, from Web development, Art creation, Game Development, Music, and so much more. Based in Dallas, Texas, Sane has been working as a Freelance artist for many years, starting with stick figure doodles as a child, then working to find his own unique style at the age of 16 when he began taking his art journey much more seriously. His main focus is to bring some of his favorite characters to life through art, whether it be from Anime, Mangaka, Video Games, or Cartoons. Primarily, Sane does NSFW content, delving into the wonderful world of erotic art around the age of 20. Sane is currently working to establish his brands and projects as well as produce artwork of the highest possible quality. Some of his personal projects he's worked on/is currently working on includes TheGeeksFactory, JigglyToonz(DISCONTINUED), JIGGLYWAIFUS, SIMON 
					(WEBCOMIC)(DISCONTINUED), HEAVENANCE(HENTAI COMICS), and a YouTube channel that supports his process videos.</p>
