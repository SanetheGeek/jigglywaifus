		<p id="three"> PROJECT HEAVENANCE is a subsidiary of THEGEEKSFACTORY that lets me dabble into the world of Comics, specifically Erotic Hentai Comics. With this project in particular, I am able to create very detailed works that viewers can read at their own leisure. Since these kinda of comics can take quite a bit of time to create, they will be in color as well, I've decided to put them behind paywall, albeit at a small fee. The main goal of PROJECT HEAVENANCE is to bring you some of the best hentai comics that I can create at the highest possible quality to ensure that the viewer who are purchasing and reading said comics are satisfied with the products that I am producing. I do NOT endorse, condone, or promote Child Pornography, this includes Lolicons and Shotacon, albeit fictional, is quite disturbing.  </p>
