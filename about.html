			<p id="three"> TheGeeksFactory is a multi-faceted project created by Sane the Geek that explores a wide range of Artistic endeavors, from Web development, Art creation, Game Development, Music, and so much more. Based in Dallas, Texas, Sane has been working as a Freelance artist for many years, starting with stick figure doodles as a child, then working to find his own unique style at the age of 16 when he began taking his art journey much more seriously. His main focus is to bring some of his favorite characters to life through art, whether it be from Anime, Mangaka, Video Games, or Cartoons. Primarily, Sane does NSFW content, delving into the wonderful world of erotic art around the age of 20. Sane is currently working to establish his brands and projects as well as produce artwork of the highest possible quality. Some of his personal projects he's worked on/is currently working on includes TheGeeksFactory, JigglyToonz(DISCONTINUED), JIGGLYWAIFUS, SIMON (WEBCOMIC)(DISCONTINUED), HEAVENANCE(HENTAI COMICS), and a YouTube channel that supports his process videos. </p>


				<h4> BIO </h4>

				<p id="five"> Yo. My name is Tyrell Johnson. My friends call me Sane, however. I'm a somewhat professional Pinup Artist-illustrator. I was born and raised in Dallas, Tx by a mother of 3. I haven't gotten work from any professional companies yet, and I don't think I want to. I'm cool doing my own thing. When I'm not drawing, some of my other favorite hobbies to do are programming, writing comics, coming up with personal projects to pursue, and gaming (not too much though). 
				<br>
				<br>
				While on the topic, I am the creator of a couple of cool comics, some that have seen the light of day (and failed), and some currently still in the works. Some of the comics I've made are called SIMON, an action-fantasy comic, GUN GLUTTONS, a sci-fi action-shooter(work in progress), and SPICE AND CO., an action-romance comic (work in progress). 
				<br>
				<br>
				As far as inspirations go, everything from video games, to comics, to anime, and some other stuff I won't mention has shaped the kind of art that I create to this day. I am a HUGE nerd, and love to learn about new things all the time if the information is presented in a fun and well-informed manner.
