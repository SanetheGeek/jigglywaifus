		<p id="four">Yo. My name is Tyrell Johnson. My friends call me Sane, however. I'm a somewhat professional Pinup Artist-illustrator. I was born and raised in Dallas, Tx by a mother of 3. I haven't gotten work from any professional companies yet, and I don't think I want to. I'm cool doing my own thing. When I'm not drawing, some of my other favorite hobbies to do are programming, writing comics, coming up with personal projects to pursue, and gaming (not too much though). 
		While on the topic, I am the creator of a couple of cool comics, some that have seen the light of day (and failed), and some currently still in the works. Some of the comics I've made are called SIMON, an action-fantasy comic, GUN GLUTTONS, a sci-fi action-shooter(work in progress), and SPICE AND CO., an action-romance comic (work in progress). 
		As far as inspirations go, everything from video games, to comics, to anime, and some other stuff I won't mention has shaped the kind of art that I create to this day. I am a HUGE nerd, and love to learn about new things all the time if the information is presented in a fun and well-informed manner.</p>
