		<p id="one"> OKAY, so, currently, I am in the process of creating the MEMBERS ONLY section of the site. Since the Members part of the site will include Login Creditials, Secure Registration, and a secure way to make payments, I will take extra time to make sure everything is up and running so that nothing goes wrong when people try and sign up. I'd hate	for you all to lose money over nothing.
		<br>
			<br>
			For those who do not know yet, Members of the site will get exclusive perks, such as access to an Exclusive Chat Room,
			Exclusive JIGGLYWAIFUS Artwork, access to the H. Forums, and DISCOUNTS on Merch like Prints and Stickers when available. It's going
			to be quite some time before everything is up and running, I mean I'm creating an entire forum for you guys, so be patient with me
			as I work through it all. By the way, I'm thinking of making all of this $19.99. Seems like a reasonable price.   </p>
