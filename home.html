				<h2> NEWS AND UPDATES </h2>


				<p id="four"> Welcome to JIGGLYWAIFUS.COM! I'm Sane the Geek, and this is my little website. I coded it all from scratch (with a little help from YouTube tutorials and some obscure forum posts). The reason this site exists is because I've been pretty much shadowbanned off of every major platform that isn't reddit thanks to the kind of art I make. I got pretty tired of my reach going down the shitter and decided I wanted a place where I can chill and hang while posting my art without any repercussions from these large social media corporations. 
					<br> 
					<br>
				Today marks the beginning of JIGGLYWAIFUS.COM. It took months of coding on and off, learning, troubleshooting and fixing in order to get where we are now. In the future, there will be many more features, including a Members Only Section for paying members, a login function for said members, a private chatroom, a forum where you can post your own artworks, possibly a store when I get that figured out, LOOTABLES(stickers), and of course exclusive artwork from me. For now though, I'm just working with what I know. Be sure to check out the Gallery for ALL of my Art!<p>
