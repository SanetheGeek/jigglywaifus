			<h1> NEWS AND UPDATES</h1>

		<p id="one"> OKAY, so, I know this website has only been out for almost 2 weeks, but I'm currently in the process 
		of completely overhauling the visual design of the entire site to look a bit more professional. This is a HUGE
		update of course, so it's going to take some time with the road maps, design, visuals, animations, etc. 
		<br>
		<br>
		The reason I'm doing this, is because the original site, we'll just call it the legacy site, wasn't really visually
		appealing to look at. Stuff worked, but was haphazardly put together due to my lack of knowledge of CSS. The Members 
		Only portion of the site that I was working on just wasn't going to be up to stuff based on how the website was put together
		originally. Things wasn't going to work unless I made some serious changes, so I've decided to go ahead and overhaul everything. 
		There's still so much to learn and memorize about CSS, and as I grow, so will the site. I have a lot planned, so stay tuned!</p>
