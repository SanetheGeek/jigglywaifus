			<p id="two"> JigglyWaifus, <em>formly known as JigglyToonz</em>, is a sub project of the parent project THEGEEKSFACTORY that explores the world of erotic art. Created in the Summer of 2022, JigglyWaifus aim is to bring fictional characters from Anime, Mangaka, Video Games, and Comics into a lewd or NSFW light whether it be in digital form for traditional. The name "JigglyWaifus" is a mix of another project that goes by the name of JigglyGirls (now defunct), and the word Waifu, which is a term used to describe fictional anime characters, typically female, that is greatly loved or admired and put onto this sort of pedestal to be worshipped in a sense. JigglyWaifus does NOT endorse, condone, or promote child pornography whatsoever and is committed to creating aesthetically pleasing artwork for the viewer's viewing pleasure.</p>
